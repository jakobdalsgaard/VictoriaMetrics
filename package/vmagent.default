# vmagent collects metrics data via popular data ingestion protocols and routes it to VictoriaMetrics.
#
# See the docs at https://victoriametrics.github.io/vmagent.html .
#
#  -csvTrimTimestamp duration
#    	Trim timestamps when importing csv data to this duration. Minimum practical duration is 1ms. Higher duration (i.e. 1s) may be used for reducing disk space usage for timestamp data (default 1ms)
#  -dryRun
#    	Whether to check only config files without running vmagent. The following files are checked: -promscrape.config, -remoteWrite.relabelConfig, -remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig . Unknown config 
#       entries are allowed in -promscrape.config by default. This can be changed with -promscrape.config.strictParse
#  -enableTCP6
#    	Whether to enable IPv6 for listening and dialing. By default only IPv4 TCP is used
#  -envflag.enable
#    	Whether to enable reading flags from environment variables additionally to command line. Command line flag values have priority over values from environment vars. Flags are read only 
#       from command line if this flag isn't set
#  -envflag.prefix string
#    	Prefix for environment variables if -envflag.enable is set
#  -fs.disableMmap
#    	Whether to use pread() instead of mmap() for reading data files. By default mmap() is used for 64-bit arches and pread() is used for 32-bit arches, since they cannot read data files 
#       bigger than 2^32 bytes in memory. mmap() is usually faster for reading small data chunks than pread() (default true)
#  -graphiteListenAddr string
#    	TCP and UDP address to listen for Graphite plaintext data. Usually :2003 must be set. Doesn't work if empty
#  -graphiteTrimTimestamp duration
#    	Trim timestamps for Graphite data to this duration. Minimum practical duration is 1s. Higher duration (i.e. 1m) may be used for reducing disk space usage for timestamp data (default 1s)
#  -http.connTimeout duration
#    	Incoming http connections are closed after the configured timeout. This may help spreading incoming load among a cluster of services behind load balancer. Note that the real timeout 
#       may be bigger by up to 10% as a protection from Thundering herd problem (default 2m0s)
#  -http.disableResponseCompression
#    	Disable compression of HTTP responses for saving CPU resources. By default compression is enabled to save network bandwidth
#  -http.idleConnTimeout duration
#    	Timeout for incoming idle http connections (default 1m0s)
#  -http.maxGracefulShutdownDuration duration
#    	The maximum duration for graceful shutdown of HTTP server. Highly loaded server may require increased value for graceful shutdown (default 7s)
#  -http.pathPrefix string
#    	An optional prefix to add to all the paths handled by http server. For example, if '-http.pathPrefix=/foo/bar' is set, then all the http requests will be handled on '/foo/bar/*' 
#       paths. This may be useful for proxied requests. See https://www.robustperception.io/using-external-urls-and-proxies-with-prometheus
#  -http.shutdownDelay duration
#    	Optional delay before http server shutdown. During this dealy the servier returns non-OK responses from /health page, so load balancers can route new requests to other servers
#  -httpAuth.password string
#    	Password for HTTP Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if -httpAuth.username is empty
#  -httpAuth.username string
#    	Username for HTTP Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if empty. See also -httpAuth.password
#  -httpListenAddr string
#    	TCP address to listen for http connections. Set this flag to empty value in order to disable listening on any port. This mode may be useful for running multiple vmagent instances 
#       on the same server. Note that /targets and /metrics pages aren't available if -httpListenAddr='' (default ":8429")
#  -import.maxLineLen max_rows_per_line
#    	The maximum length in bytes of a single line accepted by /api/v1/import; the line length can be limited with max_rows_per_line query arg passed to /api/v1/export

#    	TCP and UDP address to listen for Influx line protocol data. Usually :8189 must be set. Doesn't work if empty. This flag isn't needed when ingesting data over HTTP - just 
#       send it to http://<vmagent>:8429/write
#  -influxMeasurementFieldSeparator string
#    	Separator for '{measurement}{separator}{field_name}' metric name when inserted via Influx line protocol (default "_")
#  -influxSkipMeasurement
#    	Uses '{field_name}' as a metric name while ignoring '{measurement}' and '-influxMeasurementFieldSeparator'
#  -influxSkipSingleField
#    	Uses '{measurement}' instead of '{measurement}{separator}{field_name}' for metic name if Influx line contains only a single field
#  -influxTrimTimestamp duration
#    	Trim timestamps for Influx line protocol data to this duration. Minimum practical duration is 1ms. Higher duration (i.e. 1s) may be used for reducing disk space usage for 
#       timestamp data (default 1ms)
